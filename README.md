# The-digital-world-is-more-real-than-the-offline-world-

The digital world is the one we create, the one we share with a lot of people from other places, sometimes we know that people in the offline life, but some others we don't; the offline world, on the other hand, is the one we share only with the people near to us, this is always tought to be the "real" one, because is the one you live day by day just by waking up. Now a days, the digital and the offline world are part of one person identity and life in general, the most important difference between the offline world and the digital one, could be the way we interact with other people, some people feels a lot more confortable being infront of a computer than talking with people face to face, and this does not mean that relationship is not real, it's just different, because this people are still real and the things or toughts they're sharing are real for them. The digital media and social networks makes the interaction between people that are far away easier, this does not make any of this worlds less real than the other, this just mekes them different.

The idea of what world is more real, digital or offline I believe is like the plot of [Digimon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5kmqxh_k6E) or Matrix, where the characters can change their reality, but in this context the digital world is only a reflection of the offline world, a reflection where the people maybe feel more freedom in words of Oscar Wilde: 
>“Give a man a mask and he’ll tell you the truth.”

And that´s the digital world a mask, or maybe a party of mask when the people change many qualities, proyect something in a more easy way but the reality becomes attached to something basic, to exist and in the real world your you cannot stop doing it whereas in the digital world you can leave to exist only with put your status on offline or delete your profile, i thinks the question is where can i exist in the digital world?
