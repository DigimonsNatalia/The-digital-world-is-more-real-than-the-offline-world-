# The-digital-world-is-more-real-than-the-offline-world-

The digital world is the one we create, the one we share with a lot of people from other places, sometimes we know that people in the offline life, but some others we don't; the offline world, on the other hand, is the one we share only with the people near to us, this is always tought to be the "real" one, because is the one you live day by day just by waking up. Now a days, the digital and the offline world are part of one person identity and life in general, the most important difference between the offline world and the digital one, could be the way we interact with other people, some people feels a lot more confortable being infront of a computer than talking with people face to face, and this does not mean that relationship is not real, it's just different, because this people are still real and the things or toughts they're sharing are real for them. The digital media and social networks makes the interaction between people that are far away easier, this does not make any of this worlds less real than the other, this just mekes them different.
